                    What is a fire rated <br />
                    wooden door?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A fire rated wooden door is specifically designed to
                    withstand raging fires. As a result, buildings help separate
                    and delay the expansion of fire from one place to another.
                    It also has essential safety features that play a major role
                    between life and death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fire rated doors are manufactured using some fire resistant
                    materials such as gypsum, glass, steel, metal, wood or
                    vermiculite boards. These doors can prevent the fire from
                    spreading to nearby undamaged areas and allow enough time
                    for the emergency services to put out the fire. In this way,
                    you can greatly save your property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, other than their ability to withstand extreme
                    temperatures, fire rated doors are tested for their
                    resistance threshold. This is why so many homeowners install
                    these doors. Moreover, the materials used to make
                    residential fire rated doors make them corrosion resistant.
                    It is also very durable no matter what kind of environment.

                    The rating guidance of <br />
                    the doors
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Fire ratings provide you with guidance regarding safety
                    issues. The main purpose of these ratings is to assess the
                    durability of materials used to contain fire within an area
                    while maintaining structural integrity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, these ratings are useful because they help determine
                    if a constructed site can provide occupants with sufficient
                    time to vacate the area. You may have noticed minutes or
                    hours as a way of indicating fire rating labels on fire
                    doors. It is a fire endurance rating that can range from A
                    to C, where C is the lowest fire resistance rating and A is
                    the highest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assessments are based on tests taken against time such as
                    20, 40, 60 or 90 minutes. However, the fire rating does not
                    indicate how long a door needs to withstand a fire. So, a
                    door rated 60 minutes does not guarantee that it will
                    withstand fire for up to 60 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that the door can be held for up to 60 minutes
                    when tested in a controlled environment. In the real
                    scenario, contributing factors such as heat intensity can
                    significantly reduce the estimated time.

                    How can they help <br />
                    during a fire?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Undoubtedly, no doors can be made 100% fireproof. And in
                    some fire incidents, temperatures can get high enough to
                    melt steel structures. Keep in mind that a fire door does
                    not survive a fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it slows down the spread of the fire and keeps it
                    confined to the designated area as much as possible. They
                    resist the penetration of heat and smoke within a certain
                    time frame. They also provide enough time for building
                    occupants to leave the building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While people focus more on the fire element, they
                    underestimate the importance of smoke inhalation. As such,
                    people die as a result of smoke inhalation in residential
                    fires. Fire rated wooden doors protect your assets and
                    possessions while firefighters work on fire extinguishing
                    procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the doors are self-closing, they contain a fire which
                    gives people enough time to escape. Moreover, it offers an
                    aesthetic look and is available in a variety of finishes and
                    styles. The smoke reduction features also prevent injuries
                    and deaths in emergency situations
